# Blog-Application
I have created an Blog Application. Users can by default see 3 posts. They can add their new post,edit if want and moreover can delete their post.
To use this open the terminal and write:
npm i
node index.js
//then split the terminal and in other terminal write:
node server.js
then open http://localhost:3000/
